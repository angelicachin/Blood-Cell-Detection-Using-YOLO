# Blood-Cell-Detection-Using-YOLO

This groundbreaking study delves into the transformative realm of blood cell detection using cutting-edge YOLO (You Only Look Once) modelsâ€”namely, YOLOv5n, YOLOv5x, YOLOv8n, and YOLOv8x. Employing the prowess of deep learning, the research pioneers advancements in the precision and efficiency of blood cell detection, an indispensable facet in the landscape of medical diagnostics. Notably, YOLOv8n emerges as a stalwart, showcasing unparalleled precision of 87.3% and a meticulous ability to curtail false positives. Conversely, YOLOv5x, with a remarkable recall of 90.6%, excels in capturing a substantial array of true positives. Further elevating our exploration, YOLOv8x exhibits extraordinary spatial accuracy, boasting the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) at 0.588 and Dice Coefficient at 0.654. The findings not only redefine the landscape of medical diagnostics but also hold promise for substantially alleviating manual workload through the pioneering integration of deep learning technologies.
