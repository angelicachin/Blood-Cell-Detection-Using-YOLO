# Blood-Cell-Detection-Using-YOLO

This pioneering investigation delves into the revolutionary domain of blood cell detection by leveraging state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, specifically YOLOv5n, YOLOv5x, YOLOv8n, and YOLOv8x. Harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, our study leads the way in advancing the precision and efficiency of blood cell detectionâ€”an essential aspect of medical diagnostics. Significantly, YOLOv8n emerges as a formidable contender, exhibiting an unprecedented precision level of 87.3% and a meticulous ability to minimize false positives. Conversely, the YOLOv5x model, boasting an outstanding recall rate of 90.6%, excels in capturing a diverse array of true positives. Elevating our exploration further, YOLOv8x showcases exceptional spatial accuracy, achieving the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) at 0.588 and a Dice Coefficient of 0.654. These findings not only redefine the landscape of medical diagnostics but also hold the potential to significantly reduce manual workload through the pioneering integration of deep learning technologies.
